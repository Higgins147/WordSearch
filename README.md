Creating a WordSearch Puzzle

This is a WordSearch puzzle. The program will take a txt file of words
and produce a grid with all words contained inside.
Methods will manipulate the words so they are placed into the grid forwards, 
backwards, horizontal and vertical.
Remaining places in the grid are filled with random letters
